# Operating System Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains C++ implementations of various **CPU scheduling algorithms** using **classes**:

### **Implemented Algorithms:**
- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF - Non-Preemptive)**
- **Longest Job First (LJF - Non-Preemptive)**
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF - Preemptive SJF)**
- **Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF - Preemptive LJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**

### **How to Run:**
1. Compile the C++ files using a compiler like `g++`:
   ```sh
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
